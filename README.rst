pygnutools
==========

pygnutools is an implementation of the GNU tools in pure Python. 

Work in Progress
================

So far the only implemented tool is ``find`` tool. Not even all find primaries are implemented yet.

Plugin Architecture
===================

Unlike the GNU find tool, this implementation allows plugins to be easily added. 
The plugin architecture uses setuptools entry points.

See exivfind_ as an example that provides pyfind with EXIF primaries.

.. _exivfind: https://github.com/meitham/exivfind

for example with installing exivfind_ you could do::

        pyfind ~/Pictures -iname \*.jpg -imake canon -print ', ' -print-tag 'model'

The command above will look through your pictures directory for all files 
matching *.jpg and are taking by a canon camera, then will print the file name
followed by a comma and space ', ' and print the model of the camera. Neat!

Options prefixed with i denote case insensitivity.

Unlike GNU find, ``-print`` takes an optional single argument that is used as 
a suffix after the filepath.

Difference from GNU find
========================

This tools is not and will not be fully compatable with GNU find. For example
GNU find inserts the ``-print`` implictly for you, where this tool won't.
The reason for this is GNU find is oriented around filenames, a test match will
give you back the file name that you after, where as this tool can do a lot 
more than that, such as print something from the ``context`` object that was
populated by one of the primaries.

If you're interested in printing the file names you could always do that by
explicitly provide the ``-print`` primary. I can argue we are honoring the zen
of python that explicit is better than implcit.

Getting Started
===============
